# Budget-App-JavaScript

â€‹ @Code Explained Says Hi

Today's project is the " Budget App" with vanilla JavaScript.

Our app shows, the balance, the income and the outcome. it also has a dashboard where the user can add a new entry (an income or an expense), he can toggle between the income list (that show only all income entries) and the expenses list (that shows only the outcome entries) and all list that shows all the entries.
The user can edit or delete an entry.
Our app has a chart, so the user can easily compare the income and outcome.

The user's income and expense entry list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, or reboot his machine, he can always find his data there.

When you open the folder, you'll find all the files needed to get started, the CSS code is already typed (see style.css file), as we're not going to talk about CSS in our tutorial. we're going just to talk about HTML and JavaScript.
